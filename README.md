# Document Summarization using T5

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to perform document summarization using the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model. The T5 model is a state-of-the-art transformer architecture developed by Google Research, which has shown remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Overview

The T5 model treats every NLP task as a text-to-text problem, allowing it to be applied to a wide range of tasks, including summarization, translation, and question answering. This flexibility makes T5 an excellent choice for document summarization, where the goal is to generate concise summaries from longer texts.

### Key Features of T5:
- **Unified Framework**: Handles multiple NLP tasks using the same architecture.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Available in various sizes, allowing users to choose based on their computational resources.
- **Fine-tuning Capability**: Users can fine-tune the model on specific datasets for improved performance.

## Statistical Data

Recent studies have shown that transformer models like T5 significantly outperform traditional models in summarization tasks. For instance:

- **ROUGE Scores**: The T5 model achieves ROUGE-1 scores of approximately 42.2 and ROUGE-2 scores of around 20.6 on benchmark datasets like CNN/Daily Mail.
- **Training Efficiency**: With 11 billion parameters in its largest version, T5 can generate high-quality summaries with fewer training epochs compared to earlier models.
- **Performance Metrics**: In head-to-head comparisons, T5 has been shown to reduce summary length while maintaining or improving content coverage compared to other models like BART and GPT-3.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- PyTorch
- GPU (recommended for faster training)
